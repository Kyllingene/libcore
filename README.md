# libcore

`libcore` is my pet stdlib. It implements everything with zero (0) dependencies; not libc, not an external header, nothing but syscalls I write in assembly.

It's certainly not as good as the official one, nor is it as complete. It's not cross-platform. It's not particularly compatible with existing conventions or binaries. It's probably not very stable, and certainly not production-ready.
